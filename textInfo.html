<h2><b>Monthly real GDP growth rate revisions</b></h2><br>
<h3>This little website presents information about the revisions to the monthly estimates of the growth rate of Canadian real gross domestic product. The revisions can be reviewed either for total GDP or for any of 20 industries comprising GDP. You select an industry from the box above.</h3>
<h3>In this analysis, the term <i>reference month</i> refers to a particular month for which growth rate revisions are being examined. A given reference month, for example August 2017, will be characterized by an initial growth rate estimate, calculated using the GDP level estimates for that month and the previous month as they stood when that initial growth rate estimate was released. In this example, the release would have been in October 2017, since there is a two-month release lag. Thereafter, there will be additional estimates for the growth rate in that reference month. In the example just given, the first <i>revision</i> will be in November 2017, the second in December 2017 and so on. The analysis here is focussed on the first four such revisions. Each of the monthly real GDP growth rates for reference months between February 2015 and December 2020 is included in the analysis. Note, however, that the one-month-early 'flash' estimates that were introduced in 2020 are not included in this analysis.</h3>
<h3>The first estimates for a given reference month 'm' are released two months after the end of that month. Then, as the estimates for subsequent reference months are released, the estimates for month 'm' are revised over and over again. The revisions are based on new incoming information. Some of that is simply late responses to the monthly surveys and administrative data sources that are used to estimate GDP. Data from quarterly and annual surveys are also used when they become available. The seasonal adjustment is also redone every month and this can also bring revisions.</h3>
<h3>The final monthly estimates are produced about three years after the initial estimates, once the annual supply and use tables have been estimated. These tables provide the definitive estimates of annual real value added and they are compiled using a very wide range of annual survey and administrative data, most of which only become available after a lengthy lag. Personal and corporate income tax data are key sources, as are a large number of annual industry and product surveys conducted by Statistics Canada and some other organizations. The estimation process looks at both supply and use for each of hundreds of product and industry classes and forces total supply and use to be equal in each case. The monthly GDP estimates are benchmarked to the estimates in these annual supply and use tables, which means that the twelve monthly estimates in a given year are forced to add up to the corresponding annual supply and use table total.</h3>
<h3>But the supply and use tables are compiled at current prices, so the final step in the methodology, before the benchmarking takes place, is to price-deflate the nominal value-added estimates for each industry. This is done using the chained-Fisher indexation method. Unfortunately short-term data availability limitations mean it is not possible to use this same deflation method for the more current estimates of monthly real GDP, so for the years following the most recent available benchmark year, price-deflation is done using the Laspeyres method. In this sense, the monthly real GDP estimates are chained-Fisher volume estimates with a Laspeyres tail. When the estimates are recalculated using the chained-Fisher method, about three years after their first release, the change in deflation method constitutes another part of the revision process.</h3>
<h3>This website displays the properties of the monthly real GDP revisions. They are shown both for total GDP and for 20 industry sub-components. The information here is derived from the data in Statistics Canada table 36-10-0491-01, which contains all of the real GDP 'vintages' from January 2015 to date.<h3>
